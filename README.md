There is a drop area container with some text, icon, and browse file button. When you drag any image file over the drag area, the border of the container also changed to solid, and the text “Drag & Drop to upload file” also changed to “Release to upload file”.


When you release your image file in the drag area, immediately the preview of that image will appear. You can also upload an image by clicking on the browse file button. When you click on the button, there is open a file window and you have to select one image file, after you selected it then it will appear in the drag area.
